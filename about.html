            <p>Hello! I'm Jacob Huang, an undergraduate studying computer science at Cornell University with career interests in software engineering and artificial intelligence—primarily computer vision—research. Before that, I attended the Harker School in San Jose, where I primarily focused on studying physics and computer science.</p>
            <p>My professional experience includes internships at Fortinet and Intellectual Property Law Group. During my time at Fortinet, I helped develop a customer support chatbot, now aiding over 50 technical support specialists. For IPLG, I worked on an Electron app to manage their virtual servers.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy music production, vocal percussion, and photography. I beatbox for Cornell REAL A Capella and record covers on occasion. You might also catch me rooting for the 49ers on Sundays.</p>
            <p>If you wish to contact me, please do so via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jzh23/">LinkedIn</a>. Welcome to my little corner of the web!</p>
